# Transcendence

Transcendence is an old idea for a game that a friend and I talked about in highschool. It is a digital card game where the battlefield is divided into different zones, and controlling those zones grants a player bonuses that help them win the game. The game has creatures and spells, including a special type of spell called a Boon, that has a remarkably powerful effect and restricted access.

Transcendece is technically playable, but I do not reccomend it. It's an old project, and was my first interaction with Unity, C#, and game design in general. I absolutely loved working in Unity and C#, and learned a lot from the project. However, almost all of it was coded before I went to college, so stylistic sins and insane design choices abound in the source code. 

I want to come back to this project some day and finish the game. Valve's card game, Artifact, reminded me of it, and I think the idea of a more board and zone focused digical game is rich for exploration!
